          <ol>

            with your real name and community.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Post and Reply</strong> &#8212; Sharing your
            knowledge and opinions with your fellow participants is a democratic
            right.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit on Posting within a Forum's Purpose</strong> &#8212; 
              Two posts per day per member on most forums. Forum charters determine
              geographic or topical scope.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Civil</strong> &#8212; No name-calling. 
              Respect among people with differing views is our

              forward private communication without permission.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Unsubstantiated Rumors</strong> &#8212; Asking for
              clarification of what you've heard in the community can be 
              appropriate if issues-based.

              You may receive informal or official warnings. The volunteer Forum

              your second official warning in one year, you are suspended for two
              weeks. You may appeal all warnings after a third warning that brings
              a six-month suspension.</li>
            <li><strong>Forum Managers</strong> &#8212; Each forum has a manager
              with responsibilities and technical privileges to meet those
              responsibilities. Disputes with Forum Managers may be brought to
              E-Democracy.org through various mechanisms.</li>

          <p>Participation in E-Democracy.Org is fundamentally about public
            life. 
          </p>
          <p>We seek to create a safe, trusting environment where people 
            know who has the ability to communicate publicly with them in
            our forums. 
            While this is a community experience not a private life
            activity, we do take actions to protect your privacy. 
          </p>
          <p>E-Democracy does not sell, rent, or exchange private
            information with third parties on individuals using our web
            site, forums, or services. 
            Representatives of E-Democracy.Org including staff,
            contractors, Board members, Forum Managers, and local
            volunteers may not use personally identifiable information that
            is provided to E-Democracy.Org for any purposes that are

          <ul>
            <li>For forum registration and verification purposes, we
              require real names, community, country, and at least one valid
              e-mail address. 
            </li>
            <li>Only members may post to a forum, and by submitting such
              a post, members share their e-mail address with other members
              via e-mail as typical with e-mail discussion lists. 
              We obscure e-mail addresses in the web versions of posts.
            </li>
            <li>The names of registered members of our public forums are
              listed with each forum on the web. 
            </li>
            <li>Anyone may read posts via our web site, but non-members do
              not have access to posters' e-mail addresses, and cannot post
              to a forum.
              If you wish to remain anonymous, do not register and do not
              join a forum.
            </li>
            <li>Our forum system uses <q>cookies</q> to allow you to
              maintain a logged in status and we use basic web statistic
              analytical tools.
              We do not monitor the viewing activities of users nor
              disclose such information.
            </li>
            <li>Our Content Removal Policy does allow requests to redact
              personal information you or others shared via a public forum
              that is determined to present a potential threat to that
              individuals safety. 
            </li>
            <li>Posts, including the name of the author, made to our public
              forums, similar to print letter to the editor, may be
              publicly accessible in perpetuity. 
            </li>
            <li>Forums include optional member profiles with public fields
              will be accessible to others. Sharing public biographic
              information among members builds reciprocal trust. 
              We hide e-mail addresses, but allow a <q>request contact</q>
              feature to ensure participation equality for web-based
              participants.
              Do not include information in these optional fields that you
              do not want to be public.
              Internet search engines may index your public posts and
              voluntarily provided profile information.

          </ul>
          <p>Any personal information collected by specific forums, local
            committees/chapters, or for use with other services owned and
            operated by E-Democracy.Org, labeled private will not be
            disclosed publicly.
            By default, as a <q>public life</q> initiative, information
            fields not clearly labeled private should be considered public,
            viewable, and potentially accessible. 
          </p>
          <p>Specific non-forum services, such as e-mail newsletters,
            surveys requesting demographic information, and online
            donation systems will have clearly stated additional privacy
            guarantees as appropriate.</p>
